## Complete Exercise 3.2.4

Be sure to render your document as a `github_document` (set `output:
github_document`) and submit a github issue titled "Homework 1" to your
repository when you are done. Tag `@snystrom` and `@gdicecco`. 

**Be sure to commit the `.md` output and the directory with your images!**

**You must attempt a majority of the homework to get credit for this course**

Cite any sources used (including links to StackOverflow, blog posts, etc.). Feel
free to look at your other classmates work, but **cite them** if you do! Answers
that don't work are better than no answer at all! We can't give feedback on
nonexistant code.

```{r, setup}
