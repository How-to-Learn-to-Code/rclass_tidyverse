Today we will be working with a dataset from [Project Tycho](https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/) which tracks disease infection over time.

Today's dataset tracks long-term infection rates of various diseases in America by State.

```{r, setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# The data is uploaded to github
tycho_timeOnly_link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UNC-HLC-R-Intro/lessons/import/data/tycho_wide_timeOnly.csv?token=AQdxTdVbMVfOF85YawF5KGZrS_i0xTxDks5bUKzswA%3D%3D"
```

```{r}
tycho <- readr::read_csv(tycho_timeOnly_link)
```

# Description of data

**state** - American state

**disease** - disease tracked on that row

**column names** - the year & week (ex **192802** is the __*2nd week*__ of __1928__) of the measurement

**column values** - the incidence of disease per 100000 people in each state. (Infection normalized to population size)
```{r}
head(tycho)
```

## Exercise 1 (5 minutes in groups of ~4)
**Hint:** Use `summarize`, `group_by`, and the `count` functions

### Are all states in this datset?

### What diseases are being tracked?

### Do all states have entries for all diseases being tracked?



# What if we want to plot this data?

### Use ggplot2 to plot the disease occurrance of Measles over time in North Carolina (3 minutes) 
```{r, echo = F}
tycho_melt <- tycho %>% 
  reshape2::melt(id.vars = c("state", "disease"), value.name = "incidence", variable.name = "yearweek") 

tycho_melt %>% 
  dplyr::filter(state == "NORTH CAROLINA", disease == "MEASLES") %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(yearweek = as.character(yearweek) %>% as.numeric) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(yearweek, incidence)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = disease)) +
    ggtitle("Measles occurrence over time in North Carolina")
```
**Hint:** Recall `ggplot2` syntax
```{r}
iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Petal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = Species))
```




# Reshaping/Melting data

![tidyData](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-1.png)

The `reshape2` package uses a function called `melt` to move from "wide" to "long" form data


## Exercise 2 

### Melt the tycho dataframe so that each timepoint is a row (named "yearweek") and the values are in 1 column ("incidence")
```{r, echo=F}
head(tycho_melt)
```

### Now try plotting the data like above
```{r, echo=F}
tycho_melt %>% 
  dplyr::filter(state == "NORTH CAROLINA", disease == "MEASLES") %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(yearweek = as.character(yearweek) %>% as.numeric) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(yearweek, incidence)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = disease)) +
    ggtitle("Measles occurrence over time in North Carolina")
    #geom_vline(xintercept = 196001)
    #geom_vline(aes(xintercept = which(levels(yearweek) == "196001")))
  
```

### Plot all Measles data over time in America
```{r, echo=F}
tycho_melt %>% 
  dplyr::filter(disease == "MEASLES") %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(yearweek = as.character(yearweek) %>% as.numeric) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(yearweek, incidence)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = disease)) +
    ggtitle("Measles over time in USA") 
    #geom_vline(xintercept = 196001, color = "red")
```

### What year was the Measles vaccine introduced? How did this affect incidence of disease? 
**Hint:** Think of a good way to plot this!



# Day2:

# `tidyr` package for more complicated data manipulation

```{r}
tycho_wide_timeDisease_link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UNC-HLC-R-Intro/lessons/import/data/tycho_wide_time-disease.csv?token=AQdxTfHxKKtnxxzNvQeWm5VXTBq9gZ0-ks5bUKzQwA%3D%3D"
```


```{r}
n <- 199001
gsub(".{2}$", "", n)
gsub("(\\d+)(.{2}$)", "\\1_\\2", n)
